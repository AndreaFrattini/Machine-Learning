# Machine-Learning

The aim of this project is to create a good model which enables us to classify audio files provided by the ”UrbanSound8k” dataset and make predictions. In particular, for achieving this purpose, differ- ent Neural Networks will be implemented over different partitions (or splits) of the dataset, using two distinct features directly extracted from the sound files.
